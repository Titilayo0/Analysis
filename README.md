## Data Analysis Business Case for Social Buzz
### Executive Summary:
Social Buzz, a rapidly growing social media platform, seeks to enhance its data management and analysis capabilities. This data analysis project aims to delve into content categories, specifically identifying the top 5 categories based on popularity scores. The objective is to empower Social Buzz with actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
### Project Objectives:
Problem: An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity to enhance user engagement.
### Project Scope:
•	Cleaning and organizing data.

•	Creating models to identify top-performing content categories.

•	Presenting actionable insights.

### Datasets for the project:
•	Content dataset

•	Reaction dataset

•	Reaction types dataset

Popularity is quantified by the “Score” given to each reaction type. We therefore need data showing the content ID, category, content type, reaction type, and reaction score. So, to figure out popularity, we’ll have to add up which content categories have the largest score.
### Methodology:
Data Cleaning: Clean the data by:

•	removing rows that have values that are missing,

•	changing the data type of some values within a column, and

•	removing columns that are not relevant to this task.

### Data Modelling: 
Merged tables to create a final dataset using Excel, python, Power BI, or any other tool of your choice to create your final data set and determine the top 5 content categories.
### Conclusion and Recommendations:
This data analysis project, focused on content insights, which aligns with Social Buzz's goals.
